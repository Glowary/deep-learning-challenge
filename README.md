# Deep Learning Challenge

**Preprocessing the Data**: Load the CSV file, identify target and feature variables, drop unnecessary columns ('EIN' and 'NAME'), determine the number of unique values in each column, bin rare categorical variables, encode categorical variables, split the data into training and testing datasets, and scale the data using StandardScaler.

**Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model**: Design, compile, train, evaluate, and save the results of a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras, including specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics, training the model on the training dataset, evaluating its performance on the test dataset, and saving the results.  

**Optimize the Model**

**Write a Report on the Neural Network Model**
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
